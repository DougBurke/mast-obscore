Code for analysis and extraction of data from MAST obscore files.

Input data is assumed to be in pipe-separated format - e.g. obscore.psv.

The idea is to extract out mission-specific entries from the table for
later ingestion. We also provide routines for filtering and selection
to enable simple analysis and data checks.
